SCALA REACTIVE
==============

Small framework for reactive programming using Scala. Current implementation
is inspired by the Reactive Extensions by Microsoft.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

There is some Scaladoc of the API. Starting places would be the Observable and Observer traits.

A good introduction to the .NET and JavaScript RX frameworks that inspired Scala Reactive can be
found at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/07/15/rx-hands-on-labs-published.aspx.

Another interesting paper on Scala based reactive programming can be found at:
http://lamp.epfl.ch/~imaier/pub/DeprecatingObserversTR2010.pdf

The Rx Design Guidelines (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/10/28/rx-design-guidelines.aspx)
gives good information on how to write reactive code.


EXAMPLES
--------

See the unit tests and the org.deler.reactive.examples package for some examples.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

- Many combinators still missing (drop*, publish, replay, etc).
- No integration yet with Java/Scala APIs (NIO, futures, actors, Swing, Servlets, etc).
