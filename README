SCALA REACTIVE
==============

Small framework for reactive programming using Scala. Current implementation
is inspired by the Reactive Extensions by Microsoft.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

There is some Scaladoc of the API. Starting places would be the Observable and Observer traits.

A good introduction to the .NET and JavaScript RX frameworks that inspired Scala Reactive can be
found at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/07/15/rx-hands-on-labs-published.aspx.

EXAMPLES
--------

See the unit tests and the org.deler.reactive.examples package for some examples.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

- Not thread-safe, so don't share between threads.
- Scheduling and error handling still needs work.
